                <p id="profileInfo">I was born in a small town in Kansas...just like Superman. (Well, he was born on the planet Krypton. But that's just semantics.) I was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 1966. My parents grew up in Fort Scott, Kansas, but this profile isn't about them. I like to joke that once I was born, I took a look around, put on my diapers, and got the hell outta Kansas. But the truth is my father returned from his service in the Air Force and my family moved to an Air Force base in Great Falls, Montana, where my sister was born in 1968. (But again, this profile isn't about my sister.)</p>
                <p id="profileInfo">After my father finished out his service in the Air Force, he moved our family to Austin, TX, where he continued his education at Texas Christian University, and attended law school at the University of Texas. After receiving his law degree at Univ. of Texas, he moved the family to Arlington, VA, so he could study for his Master's degree at George Washington University. I began attending preschool in Arlington. Then I guess the story continues with my father taking a job as an attorney with the Army Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, MS, where I attended kindergarten.</p>
                <p id="profileInfo">My family finally ended its cross-country journey here in Portland, OR--all of this moving before I reached the age of 6 years old! Yet the journey had not...quite...ended...I attended 1st Grade at Kellogg Elementary School in 1972-1973, when we lived near SE 66th & Powell Blvd. but then my family moved into a house in the Mount Tabor neighborhood, where I attended Glencoe Elementary School between the years of 1973-1976. But as I said, the journey was not quite done.</p>
                <p id="profileInfo">In the summer of 1976, due to my father's job as an attorney with the Army Corps of Engineers, we enjoyed the wonderful opportunity of moving to Hawaii! Needless to say, the years I spent in Hawaii between 1976-1979 were the best 3 years of my life! It's one thing to visit Hawaii--it's an entirely different experience living there!</p>
