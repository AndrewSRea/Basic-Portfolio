                <p>I was born in a small town in Kansas...just like Superman. (Well, he was born on the planet Krypton. But that's just semantics.) I was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 1966. My parents grew up in Fort Scott, Kansas, but this profile isn't about them. I like to joke that once I was born, I took a look around, put on my diapers, and got the hell outta Kansas. But the truth is my father returned from his service in the Air Force and my family moved to an Air Force base in Great Falls, Montana, where my sister was born in 1968. (But again, this profile isn't about my sister.)</p>
